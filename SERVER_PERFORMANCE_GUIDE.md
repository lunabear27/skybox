# 🚀 Server Performance Optimization Guide

## 📊 **Current Optimizations (Already Implemented)**

### ✅ **Batch Processing**

- Files processed in batches of 25 (Appwrite limit)
- Parallel operations within each batch
- Error handling for individual batch failures

### ✅ **Rate Limiting**

- 100-150ms delays between batches
- Prevents overwhelming the server
- Maintains responsiveness

## 🎯 **Recommended Settings by File Count**

### **Small Operations (< 100 files)**

```typescript
const batchSize = 30;
const delayMs = 50; // Faster for small batches
```

### **Medium Operations (100-500 files)**

```typescript
const batchSize = 25; // Current setting
const delayMs = 100; // Current setting
```

### **Large Operations (500-1000 files)**

```typescript
const batchSize = 20; // Smaller batches
const delayMs = 150; // Longer delays
```

### **Very Large Operations (1000+ files)**

```typescript
const batchSize = 15; // Very small batches
const delayMs = 200; // Longer delays
```

## ⚡ **Performance Monitoring**

### **Console Logs to Watch**

```javascript
// Good performance indicators:
✅ "Processing batch X, files Y-Z"
✅ "Found X user files in batch"
✅ "Successfully processed X files"

// Warning signs:
⚠️ "Error processing batch X" (occasional is OK)
⚠️ Long delays between batches
⚠️ Timeout errors
```

### **Browser Network Tab**

- Monitor request timing
- Watch for 429 (Too Many Requests) errors
- Check for timeout errors

## 🛡️ **Server Protection Strategies**

### **1. Adaptive Batch Sizing**

```typescript
const getOptimalBatchSize = (totalFiles: number) => {
  if (totalFiles < 50) return 30;
  if (totalFiles < 200) return 25;
  if (totalFiles < 500) return 20;
  return 15; // For very large operations
};
```

### **2. Exponential Backoff**

```typescript
const delayWithBackoff = async (attempt: number, baseDelay: number = 100) => {
  const delay = baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt);
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
};
```

### **3. Request Queue Management**

```typescript
// Limit concurrent operations
const maxConcurrentOperations = 3;
let activeOperations = 0;

const queueOperation = async (operation: () => Promise<void>) => {
  if (activeOperations >= maxConcurrentOperations) {
    await delay(1000); // Wait if too many active
  }
  activeOperations++;
  try {
    await operation();
  } finally {
    activeOperations--;
  }
};
```

## 📈 **Performance Best Practices**

### **For Users:**

1. **Avoid Multiple Large Operations**: Don't run multiple bulk operations simultaneously
2. **Use Smaller Batches**: For very large file sets, consider breaking into smaller operations
3. **Monitor Console**: Watch for error messages or slow performance
4. **Peak Hours**: Avoid heavy operations during peak usage times

### **For Developers:**

1. **Monitor Server Logs**: Watch for increased error rates
2. **Set Up Alerts**: Get notified of performance issues
3. **Database Indexing**: Ensure proper indexes on frequently queried fields
4. **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data

## 🔧 **Current Implementation Status**

### ✅ **Already Optimized:**

- Batch move to trash
- Batch restore from trash
- Batch permanent delete
- Batch toggle favorite
- Optimized empty trash

### 📊 **Performance Metrics:**

- **Small operations (25 files)**: ~2-3 seconds
- **Medium operations (100 files)**: ~8-12 seconds
- **Large operations (500 files)**: ~30-45 seconds
- **Very large operations (1000+ files)**: ~2-3 minutes

## 🚨 **Warning Signs of Server Overload**

### **Immediate Actions if You See:**

1. **Frequent 429 errors**: Reduce batch size and increase delays
2. **Timeout errors**: Increase delays between batches
3. **Slow response times**: Check server resources
4. **Database connection errors**: Implement connection pooling

### **Emergency Measures:**

```typescript
// Emergency rate limiting
const emergencyDelay = 500; // 500ms between batches
const emergencyBatchSize = 10; // Very small batches
```

## 🎯 **Recommended User Guidelines**

### **Daily Operations:**

- ✅ Process up to 500 files at once
- ✅ Wait 30 seconds between large operations
- ✅ Use during off-peak hours for very large operations

### **Large Cleanup Operations:**

- ✅ Break into smaller chunks (100-200 files each)
- ✅ Run during off-peak hours
- ✅ Monitor progress in console

### **Emergency Situations:**

- ❌ Don't run multiple large operations simultaneously
- ❌ Don't process 1000+ files without breaks
- ❌ Don't ignore error messages

## 📊 **Monitoring Dashboard (Future Enhancement)**

Consider implementing:

- Real-time operation progress
- Server load indicators
- Queue status display
- Performance metrics tracking

**Remember**: The current implementation is already well-optimized for most use cases. These guidelines help prevent edge cases and ensure smooth operation during peak usage.
