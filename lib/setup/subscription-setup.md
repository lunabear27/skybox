Create a new collection in your Appwrite database with the following structure:

**Collection ID:** `subscriptions`

**Attributes:**

- `userId` (String, required) - User ID
- `planId` (String, required) - Plan ID (free, basic, pro, enterprise)

- `stripeSubscriptionId` (String, optional) - Stripe subscription ID (for future payment integration)
- `stripeCustomerId` (String, optional) - Stripe customer ID (for future payment integration)
- `createdAt` (String, required) - Creation timestamp
- `updatedAt` (String, required) - Last update timestamp

### 2. Indexes

Create the following indexes for optimal performance:

1. **userId_status** (Compound index)

   - Attribute 1: `userId` (ASC)
   - Attribute 2: `status` (ASC)

2. **userId_createdAt** (Compound index)
   - Attribute 1: `userId` (ASC)
   - Attribute 2: `createdAt` (DESC)

### 3. Permissions

Set up the following permissions for the subscriptions collection:

**Read permissions:**

- Users can read their own subscriptions

**Write permissions:**

- Users can update their own subscriptions

**Delete permissions:**

  console.log("Trial started:", result.message);
}
```

const result = await upgradePlan("pro");
if (result.success) {
  console.log("Plan upgraded:", result.message);
}
```

```typescript
const result = await cancelSubscription();
if (result.success) {
  console.log("Subscription canceled:", result.message);
}
```

### Checking Upload Permissions

```typescript
const result = await checkUploadPermission(fileSize);
if (result.success) {
  // User can upload this file
} else {
  // File too large for current plan
  console.log(result.error);
}
```

## Testing

1. **Test Free Plan**: Default for new users
2. **Test Trial**: Start trial for any plan
3. **Test Upgrade**: Upgrade from free to paid plan
4. **Test Downgrade**: Change between paid plans

- All subscription operations are server-side actions
- User can only access their own subscription data
- Plan limits are enforced on both client and server
- Trial abuse prevention (one trial per user)
- Secure session handling for user identification
